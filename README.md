    - **nb_rbc** : number of new b-type electric buses assigned to route r and charged at a c-type charger
    - **y_rbc** : binary indicator equal to 1 if and only if a new b-type electric bus is assigned to route r
    and charged at a c-type charger
    - **y_r** : binary indicator equal to 1 if and only if at least one electric bus is assigned to route r
