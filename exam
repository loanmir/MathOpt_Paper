1. Choose the proper detail!
2. If needed describe the theoretical math representing the problem
3. State the time that researchers needed and the time that you needed -> Describe the difference (Remember that u are using your laptop)
4. WATCH OUT -> Some papars can contain some ERRORS!!! -> Can be CONCEPTUAL problems or sometimes just MINOR errors

5. Send the code sooner -> at least 2 days before
6. test file containing a small instance of the varioables, so test data were you are testing it

7. a scalability file used to do your own scalability analysis -> If the run execution is too long, get another smaller instance -> one night max

8. you must know what you present -> DON'T make statements that you are not sure about it or that you don't know -> Rather say that you guess or you assume

PROBLEMS:
    - we need to give each variable a UNIQUE name ( see constraint 60 for reference)
    - probably we need to do the same with the constraint anmes (check on interent if it is the case)
        - Check contraint 61 for reference

    - How to implement constraints 64, 65 and 66?
