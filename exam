1. Choose the proper detail!
2. If needed describe the theoretical math representing the problem
3. State the time that researchers needed and the time that you needed -> Describe the difference (Remember that u are using your laptop)
4. WATCH OUT -> Some papars can contain some ERRORS!!! -> Can be CONCEPTUAL problems or sometimes just MINOR errors

5. Send the code sooner -> at least 2 days before
6. test file containing a small instance of the varioables, so test data were you are testing it

7. a scalability file used to do your own scalability analysis -> If the run execution is too long, get another smaller instance -> one night max

8. you must know what you present -> DON'T make statements that you are not sure about it or that you don't know -> Rather say that you guess or you assume

PROBLEMS:
    - we need to give each variable a UNIQUE name ( see constraint 60 for reference)
    - probably we need to do the same with the constraint anmes (check on interent if it is the case)
        - Check contraint 61 for reference

    - How to implement constraints 64, 65 and 66?


### Questions

1) differnces between nc_jrc and nd_jrc_ct (page 14 over constraint 31)
2) Missing data for some dicts, we invent them? How? Or  do we wait for the dataset from the researchers?
3) Is it ok to create different files for the different rando problems we have to implement? 
4) Constraint 30, how to implement? why no loop for c values?
5) We have the values for the Base case with c=1. What to do for the values for the modified base case 1? (multiple c values -> we do not have the values od the inputs that depend on multiple c)
6) Implementing with dicts or with sets (like cap_b)?
7)
