1. Choose the proper detail!
2. If needed describe the theoretical math representing the problem
3. State the time that researchers needed and the time that you needed -> Describe the difference (Remember that u are using your laptop)
4. WATCH OUT -> Some papars can contain some ERRORS!!! -> Can be CONCEPTUAL problems or sometimes just MINOR errors

5. Send the code sooner -> at least 2 days before
6. test file containing a small instance of the varioables, so test data were you are testing it

7. a scalability file used to do your own scalability analysis -> If the run execution is too long, get another smaller instance -> one night max

8. you must know what you present -> DON'T make statements that you are not sure about it or that you don't know -> Rather say that you guess or you assume

PROBLEMS:
    - we need to give each variable a UNIQUE name ( see constraint 60 for reference)
    - probably we need to do the same with the constraint anmes (check on interent if it is the case)
        - Check contraint 61 for reference

    - How to implement constraints 64, 65 and 66?


### Questions

1) differences between nc_jrc and nc_jrc_ct (page 14 over constraint 31)
    1b) Should we compute nc_jc as in the paper? BUT it is a decision variable!?!?!?

    nc_jc = to the equation (min ... - max ...), which is a NON-linear equation and so we cannot solve it,
    so constraints from (31) to (38) are used for the linearization of that equation! NEW decision variables are added

2) Missing data for some dicts, we invent them? How? Or  do we wait for the dataset from the researchers?
    - Create data if not possible to be obtained
    -  work with classes and instances
3) Is it ok to create different files for the different rando problems we have to implement? 
4) Constraint 30, how to implement? why no loop for c values?
        -> Here there must be the loop for c -> so c in C!

5) We have the values for the Base case with c=1. What to do for the values for the modified base case 1? (multiple c values -> we do not have the values od the inputs that depend on multiple c)
6) Implementing with dicts or with sets (like cap_b)?
    Try to implement using classes, by creating
7) Ask clarification for purpose of variable y_rbcob in constraint (6)
8) Ask about the constraint (6) -> the variable y_rbcob!
9) Ask for L_r -> it says that L_r = ut_r * number of all old vehicles operating on this route!

usare network x per generare una rete per caso base

### TO DO LIST

- implement classes to create an instance and work with that
- the main must be short
- create a small dataset for base case to put in the model class and try
- understand heruistics
- implement base case and with heuristics
-
1) finish constraints
2) create a smaaaaall dataset to try and print the result
3) understand Heuristic
4) implemnt class "model" and maybe class "dataset"
5) compare heuristic with correct algotirhm




NETWORK X !!! -> for the creation of instance network of buses and routes!!


thing to do for 07-08/07/2025
-Rumiz: nc_jrc_max and the other one
1)  defining R_jc (needed)
-Lucas: R_jc, L_r and nob_rbc
